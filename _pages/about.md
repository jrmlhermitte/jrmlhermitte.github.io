Welcome. This is a personal log of my experiments with AI systems, agents, and
learning theory.

Consider these posts as **working notes** rather than finished tutorials. I am
documenting my process, mistakes and pivots included, so take everything here
with a grain of salt. Discussions are welcome, and I'm always open to
connecting!

### The Philosophy
The ethos of this blog is inspired by *Stargate SG-1*, specifically the concept
of **"The Fifth Race."**

In the series, the Asgard entrust humanity with their "Core", a repository of
vast knowledge and capability. They didn't do this to make humans dependent, but
to give them the tools to evolve and take their place among the advanced
civilizations.

I view AI as our version of that Core. It is a co-intelligence that offers us
the accumulated knowledge of the world. By partnering with it to handle
computation and execution, we liberate ourselves to focus on what we actually
enjoy: wisdom, strategy, and critical thinking.

This blog is about learning how to use that Core to its full potential.
