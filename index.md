This is a personal blog focused on AI-related topics. It is more like a set of
personal notes. Take everything with a grain of salt :). Discussions welcome,
always open to connect with more people!

The title comes from the fact that I believe we should be leveraging AI so we
can spend more time thinking, as it is
[The Order Of
Things](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Rocks_and_Shoals_(episode)). The
posts attempt to follow this mantra.
